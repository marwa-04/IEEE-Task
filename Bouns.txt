Closure: Is a combination of a functions bundled together(a function inside a function(enclosed)),with a reference to access the outer functions.



Hoisting: is a behavior where variables and functions are moved to the top of the scope during compiling before declaring them in the code.

ex:

console.log(myVar); 
var myVar = 5;
